    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Bio Shield began with a simple vision: to create insect repellents that protect people while protecting the planet. 
      Concerned about the harsh chemicals used in traditional repellents, our founders set out to develop safe, effective 
      solutions rooted in sustainability. What started as a small project to craft a single eco-friendly repellent has 
      blossomed into a full line of products trusted by families and adventurers alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our philosophy is guided by a respect for nature and the people who enjoy it. Every Bio Shield product is designed 
      with natural, responsibly sourced ingredients and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. From repellents 
      for mosquitoes and ticks to protective gear like nets and jackets, we’ve built our catalog around both safety 
      and sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Bio Shield is more than a company—it’s a community of innovators, outdoor lovers, and eco-conscious customers. 
      We remain committed to our founding principle: that no one should have to choose between personal protection and the 
      health of our planet.
